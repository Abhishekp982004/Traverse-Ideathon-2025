# 🚀 Smart Adaptive Machinery  
### Neuromorphic Edge for Real-Time Mechanical Automation

Smart Adaptive Machinery is a next-generation industrial intelligence system that transforms conventional machines into **self-monitoring, self-learning, and self-adjusting systems** using **Neuromorphic Edge AI** and **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)**.

## 📌 Overview

Industrial machines such as motors, conveyor systems, and robotic arms operate in harsh environments where vibration, wear, misalignment, friction, and load variations occur continuously. These changes are often subtle and remain undetected until a major failure happens, leading to:

- Unplanned downtime  
- High maintenance costs  
- Energy inefficiency  
- Safety risks  

Traditional monitoring systems rely on manual inspections or cloud-based IoT analytics, which introduce latency, consume high power, and cannot provide real-time machine-level intelligence.

**Smart Adaptive Machinery** addresses this gap by bringing intelligence directly onto the machine using neuromorphic computing.

## 🧠 Core Technology

- **Neuromorphic Edge AI**
- **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)**
- **Event-driven spike encoding**
- **Ultra-low-power on-device inference**
- **Offline adaptability**

Unlike traditional neural networks, SNNs process information only when events occur, making them ideal for embedded industrial environments.
